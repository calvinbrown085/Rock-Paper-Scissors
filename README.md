## How do I use it?

You can say something like..

"Alexa, ask `rock paper scissors` to start a new game" - She should start a new game for you.

After you ask she should ask what weapon you want,
you obviously have the choice of `rock, paper, or scissors`.

Once you choose she will choose her weapon, and then play. She will tell you what weapon she chose and if you won, tied or she won.
